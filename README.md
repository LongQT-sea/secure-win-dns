# üõ°Ô∏è Secure Windows DNS - AdGuard Dnsproxy Installer

This script installs [AdGuard Dnsproxy](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy) on a Windows machine and configures it to run at startup using Task Scheduler. It uses **AdGuard‚Äôs secure DNS servers** with filtering to help block ads and enhance privacy.

## ‚úÖ After Installation

Once installed, the script configures your system to use the local DNS server provided by dnsproxy:

### For IPv4:

$targets = Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object { $_.Status -eq 'Up' -and ($_.Name -like 'Ethernet*' -or $_.Name -like 'Wi-Fi*') }

foreach ($adapter in $targets) {
    Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceIndex $adapter.ifIndex -ResetServerAddresses
    Write-Host "`nReset '$($adapter.Name)' to use the default DNS successfully."
}
```
