# üõ°Ô∏è Secure Windows DNS - AdGuard Dnsproxy Installer

This script installs [AdGuard Dnsproxy](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy) on a Windows machine and configures it to run at startup using Task Scheduler. It uses **AdGuard‚Äôs secure DNS servers** with filtering to help block ads and enhance privacy.

## üîß Installation Command

To install the tool, run the following command in **PowerShell** or **Terminal** (run as administrator):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LongQT-sea/secure-win-dns/main/Dnsproxy.ps1 | iex
```

## ‚úÖ After Installation

Once installed, the script configures your system to use the local DNS server provided by dnsproxy:

### For IPv4:

* DNS server: `127.0.0.1`

### For IPv6:

* DNS server: `::1`

## ‚úÖ What This Script Does

1. **Installs Winget** (if not already present).
2. **Updates Winget Sources**.
3. **Installs AdGuard.dnsproxy** via Winget.
4. **Creates a Startup Task**:

   * Uses **Task Scheduler** to launch Dnsproxy at boot.
5. **Configures Dnsproxy**:

   * Listens on `127.0.0.1` and `::1` (IPv4 & IPv6).
   * Binds to port `53` (standard DNS port).
   * Uses **AdGuard DoH/DoQ** as upstream resolvers to block ads.
   * Enables DNS caching for faster performance.

## üìã Requirements

* **Windows 10 or later**
* **Built-in PowerShell**
* **Administrator privileges**
* **Internet connection**

## üîÑ Uninstallation

Run the following command in **PowerShell** or **Terminal** (run as administrator):
```powershell
$name = "Start Dnsproxy at startup"
Stop-ScheduledTask -TaskName $name
Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName $name -Confirm:$false
winget remove AdGuard.dnsproxy
```

Then reset your DNS settings with this command:
```powershell
$targets = Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object { $_.Status -eq 'Up' -and ($_.Name -like 'Ethernet*' -or $_.Name -like 'Wi-Fi*') }

foreach ($adapter in $targets) {
    Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceIndex $adapter.ifIndex -ResetServerAddresses
    Write-Host "`nReset '$($adapter.Name)' to use the default DNS successfully."
}
```
